      "description": "Think of heuristic analysis as getting a fresh pair of experienced eyes on your design. It's not user testing - you won't learn what real customers think. Instead, you're checking if your design follows proven usability principles.\n\nIt's brilliant for:\n- Catching obvious issues before user testing\n- Getting quick feedback when you're too close to the design\n- When you don't have time/budget for user research\n\nIt won't tell you:\n- If customers will actually use a feature\n- If your business logic makes sense\n- How real users behave\n\nThe beauty? You can do it in a couple of days with just your design team.",

Match real world - Using plain English or banking jargon?\n3. User control - Can customers undo/cancel actions?\n4. Consistency - Do similar things work the same way?\n5. Error prevention - Stopping mistakes before they happen?\n6. Recognition over recall - Can users see their options?\n7. Flexibility - Shortcuts for experienced users?\n8. Aesthetic design - Clean and focused interface?\n9. Error recovery - Helpful error messages?\n10. Help & documentation - Easy to find help?\n\nFor banking, also check:\n- Security visibility - Is data protection clear?\n- Financial transparency - Are fees obvious?\n- Regulatory compliance - Meeting banking rules?",

Catastrophic - blocks users completely\n\nExample:\n\"Transfer screen has no back button (breaks User Control). Severity 4 - customers can't fix mistakes. Add 'Edit' button.\"",
